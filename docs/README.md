@nix-community is a GitHub organization that works alongside the @NixOS organization.

The @NixOS organization holds all the mission-critical projects such as Nix, Nixpkgs, NixOps, Hydra, etc.

The @nix-community organization is the community playground. We don't need to be as strict with permissions. The org can host any projects that benefit from a shared ownership. We provide infrastructure and support for those projects as well as visibility.

## Infrastructure

To support our activities we have a little bit of infrastructure in place.

See https://github.com/nix-community/infra for the list of services and configuration.

## FAQ

### How do I get my project included?

Ideally the type of projects that are accepted have some level of maturity and can benefit from a shared ownership. The goal is to have as much projects maintained and not for the org to become a graveyard.

We don't have a strict procedure. For now, ping one of the [nix-community administrators](#nix-community-administrators).

### What are the rules of engagement?

The Nix community is nice. Be nice! Typically this means:

1. Argument on technical details, not the people.
2. Give the benefit of the doubt as much as possible. We all have different lives with different backgrounds.
3. Keep in mind that all the work here is done by volunteers.
4. :)

Nothing is set in stone. Think of these as the guidelines for our interactions.

The maintainer of a project gets admin access to the project they maintain. The maintainer can request that more people be invited into the org so they can join their projects team.

If you see a project that is under-maintained, submit PRs to fix it as if it was your own project. If the PRs don't get merged, ping the [nix-community administrators](#nix-community-administrators).

[@nix-community][nix-community] is a GitHub organization that works alongside the [@NixOS][nixos] organization.

The [@NixOS][nixos] organization holds all the mission-critical projects such as Nix, Nixpkgs, NixOps, Hydra, etc.

The [@nix-community][nix-community] organization is the community playground. We don't need to be as strict with permissions. The org can host any projects that benefit from a shared ownership. We provide infrastructure and support for those projects as well as visibility.

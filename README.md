# nix-community infrastructure

Welcome to the Nix Community infrastructure project. This project holds all the NixOS and Terraform configuration for this organization.

## Services

### `Community builder` - build01.nix-community.org

We provide an x86 build machine as a public remote builder for the nix community, this machine also has an aarch64 machine configured as its own remote builder.

See [here](roles/builder/README.md) for more information.

### `Continuous integration`

We provide x86 and aarch64 linux CI via these systems:

- `Hercules` - https://hercules-ci.com/github/nix-community
  - To enable hercules builds go to `https://hercules-ci.com/github/nix-community/$REPO` and click "Build this repository".

- `Hydra` - https://hydra.nix-community.org
  - To enable hydra builds add a new project in this [file](terraform/hydra-projects.tf).

### `Cache` - https://nix-community.cachix.org/

All of the above CI builds are pushed to the cache.

Thanks to Cachix for sponsoring our binary cache!

### `Search` - https://search.nix-community.org

Hound code search for NixOS and nix-community GitHub organisations.

### `nix-community.org DNS`

DNS is managed by terraform in this [file](terraform/cloudflare_nix-community_org.tf).

## Support

If you hit any issues, ping us on Matrix in the [nix-community](https://matrix.to/#/#nix-community:nixos.org) room (see the admin list below) or create an issue here:
[New Issue](https://github.com/nix-community/infra/issues/new).

### Pull requests from forks
As PRs from forks don't have automatic CI checks, admins can test PRs by posting a comment on the PR instead.

* `bors try` - check if the PR builds.
* `bors merge` - same as `bors try` but will also merge the PR if it builds successfully.
